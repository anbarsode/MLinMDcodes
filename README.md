# MLinMDcodes  
Contains various codes to run LAMMPS simulations, preprocess generated data, and train machine learning algorithms (Pix2Pix-GAN in keras and SRCHNN in pytorch) with it.  
These codes are associated with the paper "Bypassing Traditional Molecular Dynamics with Artificial Neural Networks" by Ankur Barsode and Aneesh A.M. presented in the 2nd International Conference on Recent Advances in Fluid and Thermal Sciences (iCRAFT 2021) conducted by BITS Pilani, Dubai campus.
